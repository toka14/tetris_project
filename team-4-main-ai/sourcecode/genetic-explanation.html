                <p class="text-break">Genetic algorithms (GAs for short) are algorithms designed to solve optimization
                    problems. They are based on the theory of evolution and natural selection, in which generations of a
                    species adapt and develop to fit their circumstances as much as possible. GAs find solutions with
                    processes inspired by natural selection such as selection, crossover and mutation. The more
                    generations a GA has undergone, the more likely that generation has the best possible solution to
                    the problem it was given.</p>

                    GAs are heavily inspired by natural processes, so the terms are also based off of it. A GA starts
                    with a population of a chosen amount of individuals with each having a set of randomly generated
                    parameters, the first generation. After each individual has been evaluated on their parameters and
                    received a fitness-score, breeding begins. The breeding process can vary from application to
                    application, but in general the best fitting individuals are chosen to create children with each
                    other. During the creation of a child, each parameter gets randomly selected from the parents, this
                    is called crossover. After this process, each parameter has a chance to be slightly mutated, so that
                    random variation can bring change. The breeding process is repeated until there is a new generation
                    as big as the original one, and this process then keeps repeating itself. The more generations have
                    passed, the more optimised the current generation and thus the solution is.</p>

                    GAs are used to optimise a process or to find the best possible solution to a problem. It has many
                    uses and applications in a wide variety of fields (if not every field), such as medicine and
                    pharmaceutics, engineering, robotics and finance to name a few. In engineering a new type of wing,
                    for example, the ratio of lift to drag can be optimised by using a GA to predict the optimal
                    parameters of the design (material used, measurements, etc.).
